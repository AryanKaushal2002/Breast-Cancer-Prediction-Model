# Breast Cancer Prediction Model
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that implements a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer. The model is built using Python and various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

- The model is trained on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
- The dataset consists of various features such as tumor size, cell shape, clump thickness, and diagnosis (malignant or benign).

## Notebook

- The Jupyter Notebook file for the breast cancer prediction model can be found [here](https://github.com/AryanKaushal2002/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model-Using-ML/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20using%20ML/Breast_Cancer_Classification_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb).
- The notebook provides a step-by-step guide on loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Usage

To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
2. Place the dataset file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
4. Run the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and make predictions.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed within the Jupyter Notebook.
